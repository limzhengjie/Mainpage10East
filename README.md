# 10East MainPage Reverse Engineering

## Overview

This project involves reverse-engineering the main page of the 10East website. The goal was to recreate the front-end layout and functionality using modern web development tools and practices, such as Docker Compose, Django, Node.js, and TailwindCSS.

## Project Structure

- **Docker Compose**: Utilized to manage and orchestrate the services needed for the application, including the web server and any required databases.
- **Django**: Employed as the back-end framework to handle server-side logic and render HTML templates.
- **Node.js**: Used for running the development server and managing dependencies with npm.
- **TailwindCSS**: Integrated for efficient styling and responsiveness across different devices.

## Reverse Engineering Process

1. **Analyzed the Original 10East MainPage**:
   - Reviewed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used in the original site.
   - Documented the structure, styles, and functionality present on the main page.

2. **Download the Front-End and edit the HTML and Javascript**:
   - Built the layout using **HTML5** and **TailwindCSS** for responsive design.
   - Ensured the styling matched the original site as closely as possible.

3. **Back-End Integration**:
   - Set up a basic **Django** project to serve the static files and manage any dynamic content.
   - Configured **Docker Compose** to run the Django server and manage dependencies.

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - Managed JavaScript and CSS dependencies with **npm**.
   - Set up **TailwindCSS** for utility-first CSS styling, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

5. **Testing & Optimization**:
   - Ensured that the recreated page was fully responsive and cross-browser compatible.
   - Tested the pageâ€™s performance and optimized the assets to ensure fast load times.
